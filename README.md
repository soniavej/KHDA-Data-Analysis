Almost all the curriculums have the enrolments in “Acceptable “ and “ Good” rating Schools.
There are fewer enrolments in American, SABIS and Other Asian curriculum of “Very Good” and “Outstanding Schools”. Therefore, we can say that students studying in these curriculum are not getting the high quality of education.

Spread:

71 Locations are divided into 12 Main Regions

There are very few options of Very Good & Outstanding Rated Schools below AED 40,000
There is a market gap for schools in the range between AED 40K- 50K
The majority of “Very Good” and “Outstanding” Schools charge average fees over AED 50,000


Conclusions:
1. There is a scope for investors to open the schools in the fees range of AED 40K-50K
2. More American , SABIS and other asian curiculum schools should be encouraged to open
3. Schools of "Outstanding" schools are needed in Al Nahda 2, AL Twar 2,Dubai Festival City, Jabel Ali, Jumeirah 1,Nakheel, Outside Dubai City Areas and UMM Al Sheif. Therefore steps should be taken to improve the quality of schools in these regions

“Though the overall Quality of Education in Dubai has improved in the past few years. But We need to look at the gaps as per the Availability, Spread and Cost of High-Quality Education, to help Dubai making it true that Not just Education But High Standard Education is the Right of every Citizen.”
